    # In this case, we have a StudentCreate instance in the student variable. This is an object with attributes, so we use .model_validate() to read those attributes.

# And it generates it based on the code you write, using the Pydantic models (in this case SQLModel models) and type annotations to know the schemas of the data that the API handles.

# The StudentUpdate model has all the fields with default values, because they all have defaults, they are all optional, which is what we want.
# But that also means that if we just call student.model_dump() we will get a dictionary that could potentially have several or all of those values with their defaults, for example:
# {
#     "first_name": None,
#     "last_name": None,
#     "email": None,
#     "password": None
# }
# And then, if we update the student in the database with this data, we would be removing any existing values, and that's probably not what the client intended.
# But fortunately Pydantic models (and so SQLModel models) have a parameter we can pass to the .model_dump() method for that: exclude_unset=True.
# This tells Pydantic to not include the values that were not sent by the client. Saying it another way, it would only include the values that were sent by the client.
# So, if the client sent a JSON with no values:
# {}
# Then the dictionary we would get in Python using student.model_dump(exclude_unset=True) would be:
# {}
# But if the client sent a JSON with:
# {
#     "name": "Deadpuddle"
# }
# Then the dictionary we would get in Python using student.model_dump(exclude_unset=True) would be:
# {
#     "name": "Deadpuddle"
# }
# if the client sends {"name": null}, then student.model_dump(exclue_unset=True) would be {"name": None}
# because the client specified a value rather than not sending anything and this can cause errors. if the column is meant to be non null

# A better way to create sessions. use dependencies. Why? Most of the time, the traditional method is good but in many use cases we would want to use FastAPI Dependencies, for example to verify that the client is logged in and get the current user before executing any other code in the path operation.

        # Because it is called once per request, we will still get a single session per request as we should, so we are still fine with that. âœ…
